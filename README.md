# Brain-Tumour-Classification-using-Image-processing
In this paper, we have obtained a dataset containing 3064 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumours: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumour, and compared different algorithms which can efficiently detect the types of tumours and in the case of normal tissue. We have used both modern classifiers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost) which were implemented using Python packages such as Keras and Tensorflow. While comparing these classifiers, we can conclude that XG Boost classifiers are more accurate for image processing techniques than the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithm. In our work, Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision trees (XGBoost) gained the highest accuracy at 99.45 percent and successfully classified the images into 3 categories: Glioma Tumour, Meningioma Tumour, and Pituitary Tumour. The main aim of this paper is to devise the perfect method for the segmentation and classification of tumours based on the behaviour and structure of those tissues.
